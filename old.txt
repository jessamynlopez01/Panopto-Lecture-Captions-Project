All right, moving along now to civilizations of the middle horizon. We're going to talk briefly about Wari and Tiwanaku Empires.
0:01
So during the Middle Horizon, which lasts from about about A.D. 600 to 1000,
0:12
much of Andean South America was incorporated in two large political domains.
0:17
One of these was the Wari empire, which was a militaristic state that encompasses much of what is today Peru.
0:22
So Wari empire. The other was the Tiwanaku empire with its capital at the city of Tiwanaku near
0:30
the shore of the high altitude Lake Titicaca on the border between Peru and Bolivia.
0:37
This city center of Tiwanaku lies at an elevation of almost 13,000 feet above sea level,
0:44
making it one of the highest elevation urban centers anywhere in the world.
0:51
We'll spend a minute just talking about Tiwanaku. Here's an here's an early historic photograph of what the site looked like.
0:55
At the center of the city of Tiwanaku, there is a complex
1:04
monumental religious architecture, including an elevated platform called the Kalasasaya.
1:07
And this is what you're seeing here. My understanding is this has largely been reconstructed.
1:13
So this may not be exactly what it looked like in antiquity, but gives you a sense of the monumentality of this site and more importantly,
1:18
for our purposes, is this enormous carved stone gateway part of this complex called the gateway of the sun.
1:27
And here I want to draw your attention, given some of the discussions we've had already, to the figure above the portal,
1:35
which would have been part of the monumental architectural landscape in this ceremonial complex at Tiwanaku.
1:43
So here's a drawing of the carved figure above the door.
1:52
You should recognize this at this point. It's a figure holding two staffs.
1:56
The staffs have condor heads. This certainly evokes the earlier staff god that we saw in art from Cavin and other examples from Paracas and so forth.
2:00
This also looks forward to the Inca deity, Viracocha.
2:14
And I'll just point out here, some of these features that we've talked about already. The sun's rays are arranged around the head.
2:20
Here we see the tears and then the lightning bolts staffs suggesting this connection with sunshine, rain, moisture, storms, and so forth.
2:28
So certain elements of the Tiwanaku state foreshadow later Inca developments. Tiwanaku
2:41
establish far flung colonies on the Pacific coast on the one hand, in the desert coast,
2:47
and in tropical areas to the east, in the Montana region, obtaining things like sea shell,
2:52
obsidian, warm water plants, and animal resources that weren't available locally,
2:58
things like maize and coca. Trade goods were carried to and from these regions by means of caravans.
3:03
And later, the Inca would establish a similar trade network linking together these different mosaic environments.
3:10
Although Tiwanaku declined shortly after A.D. 1000, it's powerful iconography and monumental architecture
3:20
we're evoked centuries later by Inca rulers who claimed descent from the Lake Titicaca region and referenced Tiwanaku as a source of power.
3:33
This is similar to what we saw in the case of Mesoamerica,
3:44
where Aztec rulers would make pilgrimages back to Teotihuacan, a very ancient power center.
3:48
The point is, in these complex political landscapes, the past is powerful and reference to either a real or imagined past is a powerful and
3:57
evocative political tool that we see being used in many of these complex societies,
4:07
including the Aztec and the Inca. All right, so moving on to civilizations of the late intermediate period, in this period,
4:12
the Andean landscape was again divided up among smaller competing states.
4:25
One of these, the Chimű empire, was centered on the city of Chan Chan at the mouth of the Moche river.
4:30
So this is a later civilization in the Moche river valley.
4:37
The layout of Chan Chan is rather unique, and its layout architecturally may provide clues to the political organization of the state.
4:42
The city center in particular is dominated by these 10 large adobe walled compounds called ciudadelas or little cities.
4:51
These compounds have a large interior courtyard, numerous store rooms, residential spaces, elite residential spaces, and also a burial platform.
5:01
Each of these is believed to have been a royal residence.
5:13
Probably for each of the 10 documented, historically documented, Chimű kings or the mythologically documented Chimű kings.
5:17
Each of these structures also at the end of its use when the ruler died, apparently became a mausoleum.
5:28
In other words, the ruler was interred in this compound after they died.
5:36
These were presumably maintained after the king's death by their descendants as a form of ancestor veneration.
5:42
This is a widespread practice in the Andes. Later, we'll see
5:49
it's a key feature of Inca statecraft. There's also evidence here for the practice of split inheritance.
5:52
This is a system in which the successor to the throne did not inherit the dead ruler's property.
6:00
So if you become king, you suddenly have to raise your own source of wealth.
6:07
And we believe this was accomplished in part through a labor tax, much like we saw in the Moche
6:12
and as we'll see later in the Inca,
6:19
this requirement of subjects under the rulership of of the ruler to contribute labor and perhaps material goods as well.
6:21
So Chimu kings may have employed such a labor tax to raise
6:30
their ciudadela once they had ascended to the rulership of the empire, to construct
6:34
massive irrigation systems that we see fed to the city's agricultural fields.
6:41
And again, this may be foreshadowing systems used not very long after by the Inca. The Inca,
6:45
we'll see Inca statecraft to some extent, is a piecing together of tools, political tools developed over centuries by other Andean state societies.
6:52
In the mid A.D. 1400s, the Chimu began to butt heads with the Inca, an outside population.
7:06
And within a decade, the Chimű in part was actually incorporated into the emerging Inca empire.
7:12
The incorporation of the Chimű lands, as we see here,
7:19
was facilitated by a preexisting road system which the Inca could simply link into their own road network.
7:23
So in this way, they were able to, the Inca were able to relatively easily incorporate this larger domain
7:31
into their already growing empire by just linking into the existing road system.
7:41
So we'll see the Inca put together an empire not necessarily from scratch, but by tying together pieces that were already in place.
7:45
All right, so just to review briefly, and I know I'm going a little bit fast here because I want to get all of this in in this last lecture segment.
7:56
Just to review where we've been to this point. We've looked at very early periods of Andean prehistory briefly. And then we looked at
8:05
the early horizon, the early intermediate period, the middle Horizon, the late intermediate period,
8:14
and now we're moving onto the late horizon, which is synonymous with the Inca empire.
8:20
So we're going to spend the rest of the lecture talking about the Inca and the Inca empire.
8:27
So the Inca empire is known as Tawantinsuyu or land the Four Corners.
8:33
You can see it's divided into four administrative provinces in this colored map.
8:38
That's what that Land of the Four Corners refers to. The Inca empire covered an area of approximately three hundred eighty thousand
8:43
square miles and would have included roughly 12 million people in this domain.
8:50
It was pieced together through conquest, in part through state craft and other political strategies,
8:57
eventually incorporating millions of people of diverse ethnic backgrounds and cultures under this one rule.
9:05
And some of the strategies the Inca used to maintain this political hegemony over such a diversity of people are really interesting and instructive.
9:13
The ruler of this domain was referred to as Sapa Inca or Great Inca and was considered to be the son of Inti,
9:25
The son god. In many depictions of the Inca ruler like these, you will see them pointing to the sun, right,
9:32
reminding you that they are the son of the sun god. This is another appeal to divine origin for validating rulership.
9:40
Much like we saw in the Maya region where the Maya tracked their right to rule to the gods themselves or ancient Egypt, ancient Rome.
9:49
This is a very common strategy across state societies.
9:58
One particular Inca ruler that I would like you to be familiar with is Pachakuti.
10:04
It was Pachakuti who actually established the Inca empire through a series of successful military campaigns in the
10:09
A.D. 1400s. We'll have reason to mention Pachakuti again subsequently.
10:16
All right, so I'm going to lead you through a series of archeological sites here relating to the Inca.
10:25
And then we'll touch on a number of other topics as we as we go through these different archeological sites.
10:29
So ancient Cuzco was the Inca capital. This is a photograph of this Sacsayhuaman Fortress or a portion of it
10:36
in the hills overlooking modern day Cuzco. So this is the Inca architecture in the foreground.
10:47
And of course, you can see modern day Cuzco down here in in the background.
10:53
Cuzco has many public buildings and elite residences,
11:01
made of finely crafted Inca stone masonry. Inca are renowned for their stone masonry and their stonework has some really unique aspects to it.
11:05
Generally, the stones for Inca stonemasonry were cut into shape with such precision and the joints were fitted
11:17
so closely between stones that typically no mortar was needed or used to hold these walls together.
11:25
So this is dry laid masonry. These blocks are just sitting one on top of the other.
11:32
But as you can see, they they almost lock into place because of the idiosyncratic nature of the joints and the precision.
11:38
So some very typical features of Inca stone masonry. Stones are generally variable in size and shape.
11:47
We'll see some examples later on where they're they're more uniform, but they can't be highly variable in size and shape, sometimes massively large.
11:54
And you can see there's no scale here, but that the central stone that has many, many different sides to it is also very, very large.
12:02
And then the stones of different shapes and sizes surrounding it.
12:12
Stones are very precisely shaped. No mortar is necessary. The exterior faces are left plain,
12:17
so no designs carved into the exteriors of these. They are smoothed through a process of of picking the faces,
12:24
but there's no design in them. And they really knew what they were doing.
12:33
This is very high quality workmanship. Many of these walls are still standing and have resisted centuries of of the
12:38
elements and in human intervention and so forth and are still very much intact.
12:50
It is a testament to the original builders. And you can see there's almost a playfulness to it and an artistry.
12:55
You know, they could have made all of these just square blocks, but they chose to impose this unique geometry on them.
13:03
And in part, this is helping, like I said, lock the pieces together and keep them in place.
13:09
Now, this is what you would find on elite residences, government buildings,
13:16
religious buildings. Commoner residences in Cuzco and other parts of the empire,
13:20
in contrast, would have been made of plain stone and adobe. You wouldn't see this level of precision in the stone work in everyday houses.
13:26
Right. So this is for special buildings. Here's some more images of the
13:34
Sacsayhuaman fortress. Again, this was a large military installation, today
13:40
an archaeological site on a hill above Cuzco and provides a really nice illustration of this Inca stonemasonry
13:45
as you can see in these photographs.
13:54
Another building associated with Inca Cuzco is the Temple of the Sun or or the Qoricancha, which means Golden Courtyard.
13:59
This was a temple dedicated to the god Inti, again the sun God, and was built by Pacakuti at the center of Cuzco.
14:09
This was actually the most important Inca ritual building in the city.
14:17
It was lavished with gold ornamentation. And we know that mummies of former rulers and their spouses were kept in this temple
14:21
Qoricancha. Today, the base of the temple is still visible, as you can see in this photograph.
14:30
On top of the base of the temple is a church church of Santo Domingo.
14:39
So the temple was partly leveled in the European conquest of Cuzco.
14:47
And then this church architecture built directly on top of it.
14:53
This should remind you of something we talked about previously when we talked about Tenochtitlan in the temple of Huitzilopochtli,
14:57
and the early Spanish colonial church that was then built using the stones from the temple of Huitzilopochtli,
15:04
that had been on top of the temple of Mayor.
15:10
We talked about this idea of transformation of indigenous religious spaces as a conquest process.
15:15
This is a a process of dismantling and replacing the indigenous religious system by that of the European colonists.
15:24
Right. And we see this in many different world contexts, pointing out the example in Mexico City.
15:36
Here's another example. The Southwest where I work, we find examples of this where mission churches have been placed directly on top of,
15:42
for example, Pueblo religious architecture. This is a very common pattern in different world regions where this colonial encounter happened.
15:50
And I would refer to this particular example as a case of ritual superposition,
15:59
Which means a later ceremonial structure built on top of an earlier one.
16:07
Essentially as an act of conquest and as an active replacement. Now, this is very different from the process of entombment that we saw,
16:12
for example, in Maya temples, where a later temple is built over an encompassing the earlier temple.
16:23
This is more of a, you know, replacement behavior that we're seeing here where the the original indigenous temple is leveled to its foundations.
16:28
And then a new building is built right on top of that as this very symbolic act of replacement.
16:39
And even coopting the importance of this place in the landscape, you know. It's saying we know this is an important place,
16:47
and now, you know, we're putting this this new structure in its in its location.
16:56
When you begin looking for these kinds of processes, when you're keyed into these kinds of colonial conquest processes,
17:04
you'll start seeing this in architecture and in different world regions.
17:11
And this is a an excellent example of. So Cuzco functions were mainly administrative.
17:15
It was not exactly a commercial center. There's no large marketplace like we saw in Tlatelolco,
17:24
the sister city of Tenochtitlan in the Aztec empire.
17:31
There are state storehouses, though, at Cuzco where the government kept goods it received as taxes.
17:34
So Inca government included an elaborate state bureaucracy with systems of taxation and record keeping.
17:40
One of the devices that was used in record keeping is called the Quipo. Quipo is the
17:49
term for an elaborate ordered string device that was used by the Inca for keeping records.
17:54
So the Inca had no writing system in a traditional sense.
18:02
And this is one of the truly amazing thing about the Inca empire is unlike those Mesoamericas civilizations, they had no indigenous writing system.
18:04
And yet all of this was still possible. They did have these record keeping devices, though, such as the Quipo.
18:13
Now, the system used here has not been entirely deciphered, but basically knots on these strings record information in a base 10 counting system.
18:21
You could also include non-numerical information.
18:33
Sometimes we see different colors of string, which may be recording non-numerical kinds of information.
18:37
So state officials would have used these kinds of devices for keeping track of state business.
18:45
They might record, for example, the inventory of a warehouse where they might record the collection of tribute from,
18:51
you know, outlying groups of people using these devices.
19:01
And then it would essentially be a read-only device to record the information once you make the knots.
19:04
And you you don't change it. Right. So a a permanent record.
19:09
There's some evidence that this kind of device was once used fairly widely over
19:15
a larger area of South and Central America than than just the Inca empire.
19:20
There's different kinds of devices like this. And as I said, we haven't exactly deciphered all the ins and outs of the Inca system yet.
19:24
So the Inca government itself, played a central role in collection and redistribution of goods, including craft goods,
19:38
and so consequently, private trade occurred at a fairly low level in the Inca empire.
19:48
Unlike some of the other state societies we've looked at. So whereas markets were more important in Mesoamerica,
19:52
large scale storage facilities and centralized state redistribution played more of an important role in the Inca empire.
20:00
The Inca state would collect different kinds of materials as tribute, so different kinds of goods and resources,
20:09
they would collect them in warehouses and then redistribute redistribute them to different parts of the empire, different populations as needed.
20:16
So, for example, there are early Spanish accounts that report warehouses filled with weapons, filled with sandals, filled with clothing,
20:25
filled with food and so forth, that the government stockpiled and then redistributed back outward to different populations.
20:33
So consequently, private trade, like we see it in other contexts, was was less important in the Inca empire is a different kind of economy.
20:43
As mentioned a couple of times earlier, the Inca also implemented a system of non-voluntary labor tribute.
20:51
This is called Mit'a. This was used to construct, to complete construction tasks and other state sponsored projects.
20:58
So under Inca rulership, you would owe the central Inca government a certain amount of time and Labor,
21:09
you know, on a I guess, annual basis and would have to contribute some labor to these state projects.
21:17
So moving on to another archeological site that I want you to know about, you've probably heard of the site of Machu Picchu.
21:26
This is perhaps the most famous Inca site and one of the most famous archeological sites anywhere in the world.
21:34
Machu Picchu was a royal Inca estate. It was built by Patchakuti and it was used by his heirs.
21:43
This is a site situated in a high saddle between two mountains.
21:52
It's located on the Urubamba River. This is quite an inaccessible site.
21:57
It's not, you know, down in the valley, it's not somewhere that you can easily get to.
22:05
It's up in this mountain, mountain saddle area and was fairly well hidden.
22:09
We have reason to believe that it remained hidden to Europeans until the early 20th century.
22:16
There's evidence that Spanish conquistadors actually didn't know about the existence of this site.
22:23
And I'll show you archaeological evidence in a minute that early Spaniards never actually visited Machu Picchu.
22:29
In fact, this site only came to the attention of the outside world in the early nineteen hundreds.
22:39
Through the efforts of an explorer named Hiram Bingham. I don't have a lot to say about Hiram Bingham except to point out that he was one of
22:45
the models providing inspiration for the Indiana Jones character in the movie.
22:55
You can perhaps get a sense of that from his attire and attitude in these photographs.
23:02
So Machu Picchu was defensible. It is up in this high mountain saddle, but it's not, strictly speaking, a military installation.
23:11
It is more like a seasonal residence for Pachakuti and
23:21
his family. The seat of government in the off season, so to speak.
23:26
It contains primarily elaborate residences for these elite individuals when they stayed here on a seasonal basis.
23:33
As you can see, it's a beautiful location. The site is set in this very high altitude context
23:44
among mountain peaks. And to some extent, this reflects the importance of importance of these elements in Inca religion.
23:51
Mountains in particular. And there are many ritual features at the site.
23:59
One of the most important of these ritual features at Machu Picchu is this stone pillar.
24:06
This is actually a fairly small stone pillar referred to as the Intihuatana, which means hitchingpost to the sun.
24:12
We don't fully understand how these features were used, but we know that they were an important component of Inca religion.
24:21
This term, hitchingpost to the sun, one of the symbolic functions of these objects was as a a point to which the sun was tethered.
24:31
If you imagine, you know, an imaginary string connecting the sun to this pillar, the pillar was what kept the sun on its correct annual course.
24:42
It's what kept it in the correct location, in the sky, on the equinox and on the solstice, for example.
24:54
Right. And so it pertains in some sense to maintaining the continual natural order of things,
25:01
to maintaining, you know, everything that that the sun brings again to an agricultural people.
25:09
We know these were very important, though, in Inca religion, although we don't fully understand how they were used.
25:16
We know they were important because they were almost invariably destroyed by Spanish
25:23
invaders as part of the conquest because of their association with with native religion.
25:30
All right. So this is the bit of information I was mentioning as evidence that Machu Picchu was never visited by Europeans,
25:36
at least in the conquest period, the Intihuatana at Machu Picchu is intact.
25:44
As you can see here, the pillar itself is is not broken.
25:50
It's complete, suggesting that, you know, this was never actually discovered by by early Europeans or it would have been destroyed
25:54
is the is the implication.
26:03
So the Inca empire was tied together by an extensive road network which served as a conduit for commerce, for communication.
26:09
And the Inca actually linked the road systems of conquered peoples into their own,
26:20
such as the Chimu mentioned a little bit earlier, creating this large network of roads that criss crossed the Andes.
26:23
Altogether, the Inca road system made up more than 25,000 miles.
26:32
All right. And you can see remains of some of these roads. They're more formal in some areas than others with pavement and so forth.
26:40
You can see segments of these roads today. The Inca were also renowned for their bridges, particularly suspension bridges.
26:47
Now, these are replicas. Obviously, these are not bridges that have survived since Inca times because they're they're primarily made a fiber.
26:56
But part of the Inca road system would have been the suspension bridges that cross over the
27:04
not infrequent chasms that you run into when you're crossing this this Andean landscape.
27:10
And although this looks complicated, I've watched a movie called Secrets of Lost Empires,
27:19
Inca, where they do an experiment replicating one of these bridges.
27:25
They have a local population harvest grasses, it's essentially made out of grass.
27:29
And over the course of I want to say something like three days, it was a very short period of time,
27:35
they showed people, you know,
27:41
winding the grasses into string and then winding the string into larger cords and creating the cables that that support the bridge.
27:43
And it was amazing how fast when you have the know how how fast something like this could be constructed.
27:52
Right. And that it was stable enough for both people and llamas to to cross it.
27:58
So in a highly dissected landscape like that of the Inca, with all of these chasms, this would have been an important component of the road system.
28:05
Inca roads were used primarily for official state business,
28:16
so this would have been these road systems would have been used by government messengers, by armies, by trade caravans and so forth.
28:19
That was their primary primary function.
28:28
The roads also serve to interconnect this vast mosaic of environments and resources that you find in the Andes.
28:32
Right. So the road systems, in effect, link together those different environments that we talked about,
28:40
making it possible to bring goods from all over the place, resources from all over the place into areas occupied by by people.
28:46
Inca even had teams of relay runners that facilitated rapid transmission of messages
28:56
from one end of the empire to the other because there was no writing system.
29:03
You know, they needed messengers to to actually, you know, go from one place to another with with a message verbally.
29:09
And the way this was done quickly was through teams of relay runners. It's almost like a, you know, an ancient form of of email,
29:17
where it's moving very rapidly. Inca also built structures called Tampus.
29:24
These are roadside lodging depots and supply depots. They're basically inns or motels with with place to get supplies and food and so forth.
29:33
These were built at intervals along the road, generally about one day's walk apart.
29:44
So, you know, if you're a government official or a military unit traveling down the road,
29:48
you know, you know, at the end of a day's march, there's going to be one of these supply depots.
29:53
And the Inca did have a large, effective fighting force. It was well supplied by by this road network.
29:59
Ironically, though, in the conquest,
30:07
Spanish conquistadors also made very efficient use of the Inca road system and raided these camps to resupply their own food stores.
30:09
Right. So an interesting thing from a strategic point of view.
30:21
We've seen how roads and and the supply depots are really important for linking different areas of these large state level societies together.
30:24
But the road systems can also be an Achilles heel.
30:34
We saw how the Inca very effectively used the Tampu road system to incorporate that domain into their own and then
30:37
subsequently the Spanish conquistadors using the Inca road system itself to effect the conquest in the fifteen hundreds.
30:45
All right. An additional one additional archeaological site I want to mention to you is a site called Huánuco Pampa.
31:00
This is an Inca provincial administrative center north of Cuzco.
31:07
So this is outside of the immediate environs of Cuzco.
31:11
This is in one of the provinces that had been brought under control.
31:16
This site had an enormous central plaza with a large stone platform at its center.
31:23
This is the stone platform here. We'll talk about the functions of that momentarily.
31:29
And here's a map of the site. So large, open air plaza for public events.
31:34
Here's a stone platform and then buildings ringing the plaza.
31:40
The functions of Huanuco Pampa were mainly administrative. But there is evidence for state control of cloth production at the site.
31:46
We know there was cloth production happening because we find some of the technology that's used in the production of cloth.
31:56
And we believe that it was state controlled because most of that evidence is found in these structures right around the Central Plaza area.
32:09
In other words, in the area that's most closely associated with governmental functions at at the site.
32:18
So how do we know they were producing textiles, were producing fibers at all?
32:27
This is an interesting conundrum because sometimes in in very dry environments, you will find textiles themselves.
32:34
But often even in places like Peru, in many archeological contexts, the textiles themselves do not survive.
32:41
If you get lucky and you're in the desert coast region or very high altitude textiles will survive.
32:47
But in other contexts, they do decay. Just because the sites are exposed to, you know, the usual range of of natural elements.
32:53
And yet we know, you know, textiles were very important in these societies, economically and socially.
33:04
So how do we see evidence for this archeologically? I've run into the same problem in the Southwest.
33:10
We know the societies where I work that prehistorically they were producing
33:16
textiles and textiles were really important in those political and economic systems.
33:22
But only rarely do you find evidence for the archaeologically. So how do we say anything archeologically about this kind of a production?
33:28
The trick is finding those elements of the technology that don't decay.
33:39
And in weaving,
33:44
there's a couple of different elements that are usually made out of nonperishable materials that can give us clues that people are weaving textiles.
33:46
In the southwest, there certain features that you find in the floor that indicate there was a loom and upright loom.
33:55
Another bit of evidence is something called the spindle whorl. We find these in the southwest.
34:03
They find them in the Andes. And this is actually the main source of evidence at Huanuco Pampa.
34:08
So a spindle whorl is this kind of disc shaped device.
34:14
They can either be made purposely out of ceramic or out of stone.
34:19
Very often people reuse broken pottery.
34:24
So if a pot breaks, they will shape a piece of the broken pot into a disc and pierce it with a hole and reuse it as a spindle world.
34:28
We find those very, very commonly in the southwest. This one looks like it was made purposely as a spindle whorl.
34:35
In any event, there are these very easily recognizable discs made out of stone or ceramic with a hole in the middle.
34:43
And what they do is they serve as a weight. So as you're you're turning the raw fiber into thread for use in weaving, the
34:49
spindle whorl serves to provide balance and weight as you're spinning the thread.
35:01
I'm stumbling over my words because I don't know exactly how thread is spun.
35:11
And so I am missing some of the technological jargon here.
35:15
But it's this letter C here in the diagram. It's on the base of the ball of thread that's being spun
35:18
and it's a critical component of this technology.
35:26
So they would find spindle whorls in some of these structures and concentrated in these areas around the plaza,
35:29
suggesting state control of textile production. And we know that cloth had great social significance in the Andes.
35:37
Textiles were exchanged during all kinds of life rituals, such as marriage celebrations and during major political events.
35:45
These were important both economically and socially.
35:54
So the Inca state control of textile production, therefore, would have provided the government with a major source of capital.
35:59
It could have used this as a source of income for raising armies, paying workers and and so forth.
36:07
Right. So this is one of the kinds of craft items that would have been under state control, providing a source of political capital to speak.
36:14
There is also evidence at Huanaca Pampa for large storage vessels used in the production of chicha. Chicha is maize beer, an alcoholic beverage.
36:26
We believe chicha may have been distributed to the local population during state sponsored feasts and public ceremonies in that central plaza.
36:38
All right. So this is an outlying population that was brought under Inca control.
36:49
Inca government occasionally would sponsor these feasts, basically to keep the population happy,
36:55
to make it seem like this was a benevolent arrangement. You know, this new administration they were under would provide for them occasionally.
37:03
And so such feasts perhaps centered on, you know,
37:14
this large structure in in the plaza may have been used to promote loyalty of these local peoples to the Inca state.
37:17
So we know, like Inca brought outlying populations into the empire through conquest.
37:26
Yes. But also through diplomacy and through, you know, subtle manipulations of ideology.
37:33
Generally, the Inca only modified a region's local pre-Inca government
37:39
if it was fragmentary or if there was resistance to Inca rule.
37:45
Their first choice was to simply leave the existing government administration in place while ultimately controlling it from afar,
37:49
but but not messing with it too much as long as things were were running fairly smoothly.
37:57
They did use a system of colonization, though, called Mitmaq to suppress provincial rebellions.
38:04
This was a system where they would move groups of people from one part of the empire to another to break up dissident groups.
38:11
So if there was a, you know, local population that was causing problems,
38:19
they would pick them up and move them ostensibly someplace closer to the center where they could more easily control them and keep an eye on them.
38:23
This is also a strategy used in other state societies.
38:34
So, for example, we see instances of this kind of movement of dissident populations in the Roman Empire.
38:41
A number of years ago, I was able to get my great grandfather's birth certificate and find out actually where he was born.
38:50
And he was born in a little town outside Naples in southern Italy.
38:58
And I did some research into the history of this small town that he was born in.
39:04
And the town actually went back to Roman times and it was established as one of these dissident colonies.
39:10
So the people who founded that small town were actually from further north on on the Adriatic coast of Italy.
39:19
They were apparently not cooperating with Roman administration
39:27
and so they were forcibly picked up and moved closer to Rome so that they could be kept more, more in line.
39:33
I thought that was really interesting as a bit of historical information about the origins of this this small town where my grandfather,
39:43
great grandfather was was from. In any event, it's a fairly widespread process in these state societies.
39:51
So at the time of contact,
40:01
Just to wrap up this section, in A.D. 1532, the Spaniards who arrived in the Inca empire entered a very complex political landscape. At the time
40:04
there is an internal power struggle between two brothers over the rulership of the Inca empire.
40:15
And conquistadors under Pizarro fairly quickly toppled
40:21
the Inca empire, it fell in 1533 with the help of native dissidents. So much as we saw in the fall of the Aztec empire where
40:26
Tlaxcalans were were part of the reason the Spaniards were so readily able to overthrow the local indigenous government. Here
40:37
in fact, the Europeans captured, ransomed, and ultimately murdered the last Inca ruler named Atahualpa.
40:47
At this point, though, we also have to remember the Inca empire had been weakened by internal political
40:55
strife and their population had already been decimated by European diseases.
41:00
Smallpox, which had been introduced in Mexico earlier and which had, we believe, spread to South America even before European peoples themselves.
41:06
Remember, the indigenous populations of the Americas had no innate immunity to these longstanding crowd diseases of Europe like smallpox.
41:17
And those diseases, when they spread through these indigenous populations, just had a devastating effect.
41:27
And the Inca had already been weakened by the impact of that.
41:34
All right. So I'm going to wrap up our discussion of the Inca with that and just make a few very brief comments here by way of conclusion,
41:39
because I see where we're quickly running out of time here. So we've looked at two parallel case studies in the development of state level societies,
41:48
states and empires in ancient Mesoamerica and in ancient Andean South America.
41:59
And, you know, I think when we look at these, we can see some similarities and some differences.
42:07
And really, I would like you to think about what those similarities and differences are.
42:12
How are these trajectories that we've seen in these two regions similar?
42:17
Well, they're both based on, to some extent, agricultural production,
42:22
which makes the production of surplus possible and through surplus and control of surplus,
42:26
we can see the emergence of stratification, use of surplus as a form of political capital.
42:35
Right. We've talked about these processes already extensively. So I'm not going to go into it now.
42:42
But we see those kinds of processes at work in both of these regions. Right.
42:47
The use of domesticates and the capacity for surplus production is one of the necessary factors in both of these areas.
42:52
Now, how that played out is different
43:03
in Mesoamerica and in South America. In Mesoamerica, we saw maize was kind of the main important agricultural crop. In Andean South America
43:05
maize is important, but it's not the only story. Potatoes and other domesticates are important.
43:16
And also in Mesoamerica, pastoralism use of domestic animals was which much more important.
43:22
We've also seen differences in the economies in in different Mesoamerican and Andean societies.
43:30
In some cases we have seen things that look like market economies where goods
43:37
are essentially bought and sold or traded for for equivalence in Mesoamerica.
43:42
We saw that in Andean South America that we saw, particularly in in the Inca case,
43:47
more of a centralized collection of goods and resources and then redistribution.
43:53
And we saw different forms of rulership in these different societies.
44:00
In some cases, the personality and the person of the ruler was an important component.
44:06
Who they were was significant in the cases of charismatic leaders like the Maya rulers.
44:12
In other cases, the rulers seemed to be more faceless bureaucrats, essentially,
44:19
as we saw perhaps in Teotihuacan. And various other shades of nuance between those two extremes.
44:25
So those are the main points I wanted to get across.
44:35
Again, I would encourage you to think about what what the similarities and differences are between these two different areas that we've talked about.
44:38
I'm going to wrap up with that. I don't want to keep you any longer than I have already because I know you all need to get studying for the exam.
44:46
So I'm going to end this video here. If there's time, I will make another short video that kind of wraps up the entire course that won't be on the exam.
44:56
But just to, you know, to bring some closure to the topics we've discussed.
45:07
So study hard, everybody. Good luck on on the exam.
45:13
And I will try to do a live session some time in the coming week.
45:18
